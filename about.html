        <p>
            Hello! I’m Harhith Kumar K M, a passionate web developer and designer with a strong interest in creating dynamic and user-friendly websites. My journey in technology began with a fascination for coding, and I have dedicated myself to mastering various web development skills, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python.

            I believe in the power of collaboration and enjoy working with teams to bring ideas to life. My approach combines creativity with technical expertise, allowing me to design not just aesthetically pleasing sites but also functional and responsive applications.
            
            In addition to my technical skills, I am committed to continuous learning and staying updated with the latest industry trends. I thrive in environments that challenge me to think critically and innovate.
            
            When I’m not coding, you can find me exploring new technologies, contributing to open-source projects, or enjoying a good book. I’m always eager to take on new challenges and explore opportunities that help me grow both personally and professionally.
        </p>
